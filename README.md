Issue

start_time

abandoned/resolved

answer_time	(time an agent started working on the issue)

resolved_time (the time an issue was resolved)

abandoned_time (if a customer left before the issue was assigned to an agent)

Now when a  new issue comes in we need to predict the time the issue will be assigned to an agent. Use your best judgement to solve the above problem. You may/may not want to use all fields.
